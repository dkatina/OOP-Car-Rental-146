#Clean Code

# 1. Clarity in Naming

# --Best Practice: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and 
# classes. This ensures that your code is easily understandable and maintainable.
# --Common Pitfall: Using vague or generic names like data, process, or x can 
# lead to confusion and make the code hard to follow.

def process():
    pass

def solution():
    pass

def make_pizza():
    pizza = 'crust sauce cheese and any meat'
    return pizza

x= 1
y =4
z = 8

num1 = 1

snake_case = 'variables and functions naming convention'
PascalCase = 'naming convention for Classes'

# 2. Modularity in Class Design

# --Best Practice: Create modular classes that can work independently or in 
# combination
# --Common Pitfall: Creating classes that are too intertwined or specific to a s
# ingle task limits their usability and adaptability.

# 3. Readable and Organized Code

# --Best Practice: Format your code with consistent indentation and spacing, and 
# group related code together. 
# --Common Pitfall: Disorganized code with inconsistent formatting can make the 
# codebase hard to navigate and maintain.

def example_function():
    this_var = 'a string'
    this_other_var = 'another string'

# 4. Reusability and Efficiency

# --Best Practice: Write reusable functions and classes, 
# --Common Pitfall: Writing code for one-time use or very specific scenarios can 
# lead to redundancy and inefficiencies.
